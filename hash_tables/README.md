## Description

This repository contains my implementation of various hash table projects and assignments, covering concepts such as hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and hash table data structures. Each project is stored in its own directory with a brief description and the corresponding tasks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Linux or macOS

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

- [0-hash_table_create](./0-hash_table_create): Create a hash table.
- [1-djb2](./1-djb2): Implement the djb2 hash function.
- [2-key_index](./2-key_index): Get the index of a key in a hash table.
- [3-hash_table_set](./3-hash_table_set): Add an element to a hash table.
- [4-hash_table_get](./4-hash_table_get): Retrieve a value associated with a given key from a hash table.
- [5-hash_table_print](./5-hash_table_print): Print the elements of a hash table.
- [6-hash_table_delete](./6-hash_table_delete): Delete a hash table.

Each project directory contains a README.md file with more detailed explanations and requirements for each task.
