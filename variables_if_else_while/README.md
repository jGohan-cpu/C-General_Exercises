[0-positive_or_negative.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c): This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.

[1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c): Program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n.

[2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c): Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c): Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

[4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c): Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c): Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

[6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c): Program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

[7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c): Program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

[8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c): Program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/jGohan-cpu/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/master/variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c): Prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
