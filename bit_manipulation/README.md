## Description

This repository contains my implementation of various bit manipulation projects and assignments, covering concepts such as bitwise operators, bit manipulation techniques, and binary representation. Each project is stored in its own directory with a brief description and the corresponding tasks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Linux or macOS

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

- [0-binary_to_uint](./0-binary_to_uint): Convert a binary number to an unsigned integer.
- [1-print_binary](./1-print_binary): Print the binary representation of a number.
- [2-get_bit](./2-get_bit): Get the value of a bit at a given index.
- [3-set_bit](./3-set_bit): Set the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
- [4-clear_bit](./4-clear_bit): Set the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
- [5-flip_bits](./5-flip_bits): Determine the number of bits needed to flip to convert one number to another.

Each project directory contains a README.md file with more detailed explanations and requirements for each task.
