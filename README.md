## Description

This repository contains my implementation of various low-level programming projects and assignments, covering concepts such as C programming, algorithms, data structures, and more. Each project is stored in its own directory with a brief description and the corresponding tasks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Linux or macOS
