## Description

This repository contains my implementation of various doubly linked list projects and assignments, covering concepts such as linked list manipulation, node insertion and deletion, and list traversal. Each project is stored in its own directory with a brief description and the corresponding tasks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Linux or macOS

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

- [0-print_dlistint](./0-print_dlistint): Print all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- [1-dlistint_len](./1-dlistint_len): Get the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- [2-add_dnodeint](./2-add_dnodeint): Add a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- [3-add_dnodeint_end](./3-add_dnodeint_end): Add a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- [4-free_dlistint](./4-free_dlistint): Free a doubly linked list.
- [5-get_dnodeint](./5-get_dnodeint): Get the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- [6-sum_dlistint](./6-sum_dlistint): Calculate the sum of all the data (integers) in a doubly linked list.
- [7-insert_dnodeint](./7-insert_dnodeint): Insert a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- [8-delete_dnodeint](./8-delete_dnodeint): Delete a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.

Each project directory contains a README.md file with more detailed explanations and requirements for each task.
