## Description

This repository contains my implementation of various singly linked list projects and assignments, covering concepts such as linked list manipulation, node insertion and deletion, and list traversal. Each project is stored in its own directory with a brief description and the corresponding tasks.

## Requirements

To compile and run the programs in this repository, you need to have the following installed:

- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
- Linux or macOS

## Projects

The repository includes the following projects:

- [0-print_list](./0-print_list): Print all the elements of a singly linked list.
- [1-list_len](./1-list_len): Get the number of elements in a singly linked list.
- [2-add_node](./2-add_node): Add a new node at the beginning of a singly linked list.
- [3-add_node_end](./3-add_node_end): Add a new node at the end of a singly linked list.
- [4-free_list](./4-free_list): Free a singly linked list.
- [100-first](./100-first): Print a message before the main function is executed.

Each project directory contains a README.md file with more detailed explanations and requirements for each task.
